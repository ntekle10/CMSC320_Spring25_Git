Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing 
Answer: Merging is a way of incorporating the changes from one branch to another branch. It helps to introduce the combination of the changes in a
spacific branch into the current branch. Rebasing is similar to merging however rebasing is more simplier than merging. It gives the user 
the ability to modify the commit history in git and makes the process of incorporating the changes from one branch to another more clearer.
